  ### The Life of a Financial Query

  1.  **Data Ingestion Layer:** Multiple APIs (yFinance, FRED, NewsAPI, GNews) continuously fetch real-time market data, macroeconomic indicators, and news sentiment.
  2.  **Preprocessing Pipeline:**
      *   Historical stock data is normalized and technical indicators (RSI, moving averages) are calculated.
      *   Macroeconomic data (GDP, inflation, Fed rates) is synchronized with stock timelines.
      *   News articles are processed through sentiment analysis algorithms.
  3.  **LSTM Intelligence Engine:**
      *   The deep learning model processes multi-dimensional time series data.
      *   TensorFlow/Keras LSTM networks trained on both technical and fundamental indicators.
      *   Predictions are generated with confidence intervals and risk assessments.
  4.  **Conversational AI Layer:**
      *   User queries are processed by Gemini AI with financial context.
      *   Real-time market data is injected into AI responses for accuracy.
      *   Complex financial concepts are explained in accessible language.
  5.  **Visualization & Export:**
      *   Streamlit renders interactive charts, dashboards, and analytics.
      *   Users can export analysis results, generate reports, and track portfolios.
      *   All data is presented with professional-grade visualizations.

  This end-to-end pipeline ensures that every financial insight is backed by real data, advanced analytics, and intelligent AI reasoning.
